The CSS property `calc()` can lead to unexpected results if you're not careful with operator precedence and units. For instance, `width: calc(100% - 10px);` works as expected, but `width: calc(100% - 10%);` might not. The percentage is calculated relative to the parent element's width *before* the subtraction, leading to inconsistencies.  Another issue is that the units must match for addition and subtraction, so `width: calc(50px + 10em)` is not valid.
